# vue-play-cli

Run vue-play app with ease.

## Install

```bash
# Use npm to install if you're from old school ;)
$ yarn global add vue-play-cli

# Install vue-play in your project
$ yarn add vue-play --dev
```

## Quick start

Write your components and play entry:

```js
// ./play/index.js
import {play} from 'vue-play'
import ButtonExample from '../examples/Button.vue'

play('Button')
  .add('with text', ButtonExample)
```

### Play it

```bash
vue-play start
```

### Build it

```bash
vue-play build
```

## Customize

### Play Entry

This is not a webpack entry, the easiest way to change it is via command-cli options:

```bash
vue-play [command] ./path/to/play.js
```

### Dist folder

By default it's `./play-dist`, and it will be removed every time before `vue-play build`:

```bash
# custom dist
vue-play [command] --dist my-dist-folder
# do not remove dist folder
vue-play [command] --no-clean 
```

### Webpack Config

Merge your webpack config into the base config.

```bash
vue-play [command] --webpack-config ./path/to/webpack.config.js
```

If you want to change `play entry` via webpack config, simply set and alias:

```js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'play-entry': '/path/to/play/entry.js'
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: When you're extending the webpack config, try not to remove these properties:

```js
{
  // the essential entries
  entry: {app, preview},
  resovle: {
    alias: {
      'play-entry' // the path to your `play entry` file
    }
  },
  // they are html-webpack-plugin
  plugins: [0, 1]
}
```

#### Full Control Mode

The webpack config could also be a function which takes the current config as argument:

```js
module.exports = (config, type) => {
  // type is 'start' or 'build'
  config.postcss = [require('postcss-mixins')]
  return config
}
```

## Known Issues

- Hot reloading only works for single file components and CSS now, other js files are using live reload, we are working on making it work with JS files though, any kind of help is appreciated ;)
